High Prio:
By 16 Jun:
* Add yellow box to Advies page

* CI tests should use HTTPS too, possibly self-signed certs
* integrate prediction
  * make prediction model page work

Mid:
* the "consult view" button could be renamed "Consult verneiuwen" in order to
  remove the items which have been un-checked/disabled
  * the students suggested using a "reload" icon instead
* copy button for Epic text (copies text in box to clipboard)
* static content at the top
* get prediction model color-bar or link to why no prediction
* notification of loss of server connection, attempt to reload if lost
* record changes between views, connections and disconnects
* stash the preselect checkboxes to compare what doctor ultimately chose
* styling, e.g.: viewers in yellow, hidden when 1
* test-cafe : get the innnerHTML out of an element
* logging:
  * log whether system was used at all
  * whether Print and Send to portal was used
  * which advice was (in the end) selected
  * which advice had been pre-selected (and thus, was it unchecked)
* sanity check choices of checkboxes
* try to use "deeplinken" for FK links

Low Prio:
* specify DB port, separate instance for local human testing, automated testing
* naming consistency thoughout the SQL
* naming consistency thoughout the javascript
* naming consistency thoughout the html
* create table atc_code(id int PK, code varchar(100))
* copy-pasteable (text only) version of patient advice

Wish list from designers (not prioritized):

* Buttons to hide advice box and non-selected checkbox rows for individual medications in clinician view
* The designers may decide to have **placeholder text** instead of **pre-filled** text for the free text boxes. (They actually asked to do both; I veto'd this suggestion.)

To-do for rules:
Wanted for 16 Jun: (items marked "change to spec" have to be done by Ace)
* Add word "overige" to the plain free text box for each medication (also add to specification)

* Make sure every text ends with a period. If there is a free text box, the period should come before the free text box.
* Make sure that all texts begin with a capital letter.
* Make sure that all texts end with a period (before the free text box if it has one).
