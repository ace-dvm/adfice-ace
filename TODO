High Prio:
* styling, try to match existing mock-ups
* CI tests should use HTTPS too, possibly self-signed certs

First after demo:
* integrate prediction
	* make prediction model page work

Mid:
* the "consult view" button could be renamed "Consult verneiuwen" in order to
  remove the items which have been un-checked/disabled
  * the students suggested using a "reload" icon instead
* copy button for Epic text (copies text in box to clipboard)
* static content at the top
* get prediction model color-bar or link to why no prediction
* notification of loss of server connection, attempt to reload if lost
* record changes between views, connections and disconnects
* stash the preselect checkboxes to compare what doctor ultimately chose
* styling, e.g.: viewers in yellow, hidden when 1
* test-cafe : get the innnerHTML out of an element
* logging:
  * log whether system was used at all, whether Print and Send to portal was used, which advice was (in the end) selected
* sanity check choices of checkboxes
* fetch data button and send to portal button should be at top (by help)

Low Prio:
* specify DB port, separate instance for local human testing, automated testing
* naming consistency thoughout the SQL
* naming consistency thoughout the javascript
* naming consistency thoughout the html
* create table atc_code(id int PK, code varchar(100))
* copy-pasteable (text only) version of patient advice
