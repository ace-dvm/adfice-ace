High Prio:
* CI tests should use HTTPS too, possibly self-signed certs
* integrate prediction
  * make prediction model explanation page work
  * if there is no prediction result, show text "Geen predictie mogelijk. Lees meer over het predictiemodel."
    if there is a prediction, show the colored bar and text "Lees meer over het predictiemodel." Link to explanation page.

Mid:
* the "consult view" button could be renamed "Consult verneiuwen" in order to
  remove the items which have been un-checked/disabled
  * the students suggested using a "reload" icon instead
* notification of loss of server connection, attempt to reload if lost
* record changes between views, connections and disconnects
* stash the preselect checkboxes to compare what doctor ultimately chose
* styling, e.g.: viewers in yellow, hidden when 1
* test-cafe : get the innnerHTML out of an element
* logging:
  * log whether system was used at all
  * whether Print and Send to portal was used
  * which advice was (in the end) selected
  * which advice had been pre-selected (and thus, was it unchecked)
* sanity check choices of checkboxes
* try to use "deeplinken" for FK links
* Buttons to hide advice box and non-selected checkbox rows for individual medications in clinician view
* create "stub" functions for linking to Epic
  * Orange "Haal gewijzigd..." button wipes checkboxes and re-runs the rules on (new) data
  * "Opslaan..." button pushes data to portal and makes this tool view-only
  * "Hoe gebruik ik..." leads to (stub) training page
* if no checkboxes are selected for a medication, display text "Geen advies." in the patient view.

Low Prio:
* allow user to fill in missing values in prediction model page
* specify DB port, separate instance for local human testing, automated testing
* naming consistency thoughout the SQL
* naming consistency thoughout the javascript
* naming consistency thoughout the html
* create table atc_code(id int PK, code varchar(100))
* copy-pasteable (text only) version of patient advice

To-do for rules:
Wanted for 16 Jun: (items marked "change to spec" have to be done by Ace)
* Add word "overige" to the plain free text box for each medication (also add to specification)

* Make sure every text ends with a period. If there is a free text box, the period should come before the free text box.
* Make sure that all texts begin with a capital letter.

Important, but unable to do yet:
* The designers may decide to have **placeholder text** instead of **pre-filled** text for the free text boxes. (They actually asked to do both; I veto'd this suggestion.)
* Once we know something about how authentication will work, we may need to do something to prevent users without authentication from loading the data.
* Getting data out of Epic
* Sending data to research database
