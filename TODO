High Prio:
* styling, try to match existing mock-ups

Problems found while creating validation patients.
Probably the best solution is to switch to the SQL criteria and debug those instead.
* Test patient 137 does not fire rule 68
* why is 19a firing for patient 138
	* 19c is also firing (this is the correct rule for this patient)
* 19 fires for patient 139
* 22 not firing for 140



First after demo:
* non-medication advice (same for every patient)
* real pre-selection
* SQL-evaluator for rule conditions

Mid:
* the "consult view" button could be renamed "Consult verneiuwen" in order to
  remove the items which have been un-checked/disabled
* static content at the top
* get prediction model color-bar or link to why no prediction
* notification of loss of server connection, attempt to reload if lost
* record changes between views, connections and disconnects
* stash the preselect checkboxes to compare what doctor ultimately chose
* styling, e.g.: viewers in yellow, hidden when 1
* test-cafe : get the innnerHTML out of an element

Low Prio:
* specify DB port, separate instance for local human testing, automated testing
* naming consistency thoughout the SQL
* naming consistency thoughout the javascript
* naming consistency thoughout the html
* create table atc_code(id int PK, code varchar(100))
