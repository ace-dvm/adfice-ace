Important:
* make CDSS work on IE11

adfice: from usability
* Change for 3 views to 5 pages: see mockup
* patient information in first screen also reports negatives: e.g. no cardiac disease
* shared decision-making steps move to first screen
* look & text of Hoe Gebruik Ik knop has moved
* content has been added for Hoe gebruik ik... (we may want to improve this content)
* Add "back" button to prediction model page
* Add "close this tab" button to each refpage that closes the tab (I don't actually know if this is possible)
* New placement and formatting for print button. Add icon to button.
* Add text "richtlijnen" before ref numbers
* Change "Andere risicofactoren" to "andere adviezen"
* Change "Gedetecteerde relevante problemen" to "Gedetecteerde aandoeningen of co-morbiditeit"
* Change "Haal gewijzigde patientendata" to "Vernieuwen". Add some sort of warning that this will delete all changes.
* Change display of fall risk on patient page to match patient portal
* Change Advies page so that grey header does not display; make it more like portal view. (we probably want to keep the patient identifier at the top)
* Change "lees meer over het predictiemodel" to "open het predictiemodel"
* add "back to top" link at the bottom or in the floating toolbar
* replace prefill text with placeholder text "Specificeer hier..."
* side-by-side layout
* replace gradient with gradient as shown in mockup (with pictures)
* change FK icon to green
* some sort of UI indication that the file is locked (sent to portal)
* check refpages (last corrections were done by Bob)


Valportaal
* valportaal: links to apotheek.nl
* enlarge button for valportaal
  * is this ctrl-shift-plus ? Then maybe do both for cross-browser:
    * document.body.style.MozTransform = 'scale(400%)'
    * document.body.style.zoom = '400%'
    * (be sure to check footer positioning if there is a footer)
* search button for valportaal
  * static content only?
  * https://www.plainlight.com/duckduckgo-search.html#custom-search ?
* testing of the static/ served javascript files
* make a "build valportaal vm" script
* eject vagrant, consider https://github.com/ericherman/centos-vm
* small textual changes and links provided in spreadsheet "valportaal broken links etc.xlsx"


Required changes to rules (Ace will do these):
* Make sure every text ends with a period. If there is a free text box,
  the period should come before the free text box.
  (Laxans: should probably become Laxans aanbevolen.)
* Make sure that all texts begin with a capital letter.



Not required for "ready to install" but will be required for study:
* logging:
  * log in the same table that send to portal was done

Mid Priority:
* Each acceptance test should start an instance of AdficeWebserver
  * refactor AdficeWebserver to be more testable
  * refactor the client js (static/patient.js) to be more testable
* automate test reconnect behavior on web-socket drop or AdficeWebserver restart
* specify DB port, separate instance for local human testing, automated testing
* specify DB per-test, or otherwise ensure:
  * tests can be run in parallel
  * data mutations in one test do not impact a different test
  * ensure each test operates on separate data
* CI tests should use HTTPS too, possibly self-signed certs
* the "consult view" button could be renamed "Consult vernieuwen" in order to
  remove the items which have been un-checked/disabled
  * the students suggested using a "reload" icon instead
* record changes between views, connections and disconnects
  * see print logging
* styling, e.g.: viewers in yellow, hidden when 1
* test-cafe : get the innnerHTML out of an element
* sanity check choices of checkboxes
  * e.g.: "stop medication A" && "continue medication A"
* write a log archival script
  raise priority if this looks like it is growing too fast:

      SELECT table_name
           , table_rows
           , ROUND((data_length + index_length)/POWER(1024,2),1) AS size_mb
           , (data_length + index_length) AS size_bytes
        FROM information_schema.tables
       WHERE table_schema='adfice'
    ORDER BY size_bytes DESC;
* make black-and-white printer-friendly css (wait until vue/client-ejs)

Low Priority:
* allow user to fill in missing values in prediction model page
* naming consistency thoughout the css
* naming consistency thoughout the javascript
* naming consistency thoughout the html

Requested (not required) changes to rules:
* Rule 50: Split to personalize by age
* Rule 45: Split to personalize by +/- OH.
* Rule 45: Split into using enalapril/something else
* See if there is sufficient evidence to suggest mirabegron as alternative for G04BD
* See if there is sufficient evidence to suggest testerosterone 5 aplha reductase inhibitors (dutasteride) as alternative for G04CA

Important, but unable to do yet:
* Once we know something about how authentication will work, we may need to do
  something to prevent users without authentication from loading the data.
  * session expiration? browser caching? detect back button, return to page?
* Getting data out of EHR
  * log whether system was used at all -- depends upon EHR connection
    (EHR will provide data, the presence of the data indicates system was used)
* Sending data to research database
